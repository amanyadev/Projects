# C Project on
# Student Data Entry 

------------------------------------------------------------------
/This is a simple C program for beginners to understand
/it uses simple code and very easy manipulations
/all operations are done using basic functions rather than 
/complex things like structures and lists and other data types
------------------------------------------------------------------
Concepts used :

# switch() case
# for loops
# if else statements
# goto is the key element of this code


#Input using scanf() only
#Printing using printf() only

#Basic function calling
#Array of Characters
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
A program to test your very basic knowledge of C only a slightly
higher level..
Although the code may seem lengthy its very easy as you go through

The code contains no errors ..only a few bugs..
since no gets puts is used the name inputted cant be taken with a space 
use underscore instead


Feel Free to modify and improvise..
Thanks..
